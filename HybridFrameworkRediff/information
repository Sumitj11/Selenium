Null pointer exception is given if the object is not intialised.

Steps to create project





HashTable_Java
*************
Name of the suite should be similar to data excel because that we can get the name through  
-->>>> "Package name - " + this.getClass().getPackage().getName()); 
*************
also name of the testcase class.java should be same as the test case name in data sheet so that we can get the test case name through
-->>>>testCaseName=this.getClass().getSimpleName();

*************

What is reflection API

If variable name and function name is same that variable name can be used to call the function with same name

chapter 8
User of Reflections API - in Driver class
set up webdriver in GenericKeyword Class

chapter 9
Instead of writing find element multiple times in GenericKeywords class create common function called getObject
------------------------
Now every where we have hardcoded the sheet name "Keywords" or "Data" or "TestCases" or columns name for that matter.
 Instead of this create Constants Class under util package and create variable of below types
public static final String DATA_SHEET = "Data";
------------------------

 create Common function to find the object using xpath/css/id in GenericKeywords class
 
 chapter 10
 -- SELENIUM GRID - TO ensure that Nodes are released we have to quit the webdriver and node will not be released. 
 and further test will not be execcuted. 
 to ensure that multiple test cases are executed sequentially one after other on different nodes continously
 we have to ensure that instance of webdriver is quit so that next test case can begin. 
 to implement this create quit function in DriverClass and BaseClass 
 
 -- create validating functions - isElementPresent / validateTitle / 
 -- Create reporting fucntions 
 
 chapter 11
 checking runmode of test case is yes or no
 
 chapter 14 -
 Soft assert to ensure that program does not stop at all errors
 Also insert asserts to ensure that program stops at some bit errors - reportFailure function

 chapter 15 
 dynamic report name and folder creation
 
 
 Chapter 25/26
 
 craete parallel mail file to run test cases in paralle .
 This has to be ceated under src/test/java/ 
 execute/TestNGParellelRun.xml 
 
 Plese note that if tehre is space or underscore in xml name it will run. https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/Grid2
